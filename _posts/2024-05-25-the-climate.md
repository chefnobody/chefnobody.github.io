## What is the Truth?

Not long ago, I got into a discussion with a good friend regarding energy production, fossil fuels, carbon dioxide and then naturally into a ... let's say ... robust discussion about the earth's climate and particularly an analysis of the apocalytpic language and hyperbole that is common place today on the topic.

Personally, I am contrarian by nature and so I get rather animated when discussions trend toward extreme language and imagery. But supposing for a moment that my skepticism is founded in a desire to seek common ground and understanding it strikes me as odd that even asking questions about or poking at the perimiter of climate change apocolyptic language creates a wall rather than a door. 

There doesn't seem to be any room to ask questions anymore and that to me seems to be the real apocalypse.

Supposing on the other hand my skepticism is founded in a desire to poke an already exhuasted and angry bear, you could draw different conclusions about my motives. I sincerely hope the former is more true of me, but there's a non-zero chance it's a mix of both.

My aim is to understand this subject better and so I will attemt to briefly outline (and source) as best I can the arguments for and against the looming climate apocalypse both as a learning exercise and as a means of gathering my thoughts so I can be better informed later.
