I could stare at a sunset until the darkest night comes.

I could watch a wood burning campfire until it's embers glow quietly red.

I could see waves crash endlessly on a beach and never lose interest.

There is magic a pre-dawn hike down to the beach to surf with a friend.

There is awe and wonder at the top of every hill, cliff, mountain and vista that overlooks anything.

Why?
