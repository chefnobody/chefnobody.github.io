  <p>It’s a beautiful day, sunny and cool. The kind of day you would remember for its blue sky; for its breeze. City buildings loom high over hundreds of small sailboats. Families walk through the marina, while joggers, cyclists and athletes train on the bike path.</p>

<p>Tents dot the sidewalk. Trash and other litter gather nearby. Sunburned and filthy, someone is sleeping deeply next to a trash can overflowing with garbage. Nearby a man stands on the sidewalk with his pants down. He is arguing with someone who is not there and taking a s*** at the same time.</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>Dumbfounded, you stare at him. Unable to muster a coherent thought to make sense of what you are watching.</p>

<p>A Cybertruck drives by.</p>

<p>What century is this? 
Where am I? 
Am I dreaming? 
How did we get here?
What can be done?
Can anything be done?</p>

<p>You have no answers. It is as clear as the color of the sky; you know nothing.</p>

<p>For weeks, thoughts come and go like subway cars. Full, but transient.</p>

<p>This man has parents, maybe siblings. Children even?</p>

<p>Ah, but you do know something.</p>

<p>He is someone … and he has a name.</p>
